Welcome to the Kaguya ChangeLog.


Changelog:

Version 1.7.0

- Level formula modified so that it's a little harder to level up
- Message cache size reduced to 100
- Fixed a bug with $scrapeserver that would cause the bot to freeze. This method is much more efficient, closes #27
- Created $scrapedatabase -- creates accounts for every member in every server that has less than 3500 members.
- Fixed a bug with the updated messages logger that caused embedded links to trigger the message updated log event.
- Added help command for $sttreflog
- $groll has been renamed to $roll (but keeps the alias of "gr")
- Command $osu added -- generates a profile for your osu! username with various statistics (also taps into osuset for added convenience).


Version 1.6.0

- Kaguya got approved on Discordbots.org!! Give her an upvote here: https://discordbots.org/bot/538910393918160916
- $groll now takes points away on use, then gives them back + multiplier if the roll was won.
- $timelyreset now actually builds the embed. Same thing with $ctr
- Leveling embed is now more compact, takes up less space in chat.
- Added in ReliabilityService...if bot disconnects from websocket, it (should) reconnect on its own after 30 seconds.
- All log messages are now saved to a file (incase the bot crashes).
- Removed some unnecessary packages
- Timer added to restart application every 6 hours (to avoid disconnect issues).
- Added .gitignore.
- Changed Message cache from 1000 to 250 (to hopefully help wtih crashes)
- "viewfilter" is now an alias for "filterview"
- "$createrole" and "$deleterole" no longer require quotation marks when creating a role that has a space in the name. (Ex: Smelly Sushi)
- **Fixed a major bug with the word filter. If a message contains a filtered phrase, it will now be deleted properly. Resolves #23!**
- Took out the ability for the bot to log messages to it's own file (commandmessagelogs.txt). This will likely eliminate (potential) crashes.
    Kaguya would throw an unhandled exception if high rates of use were achieved.
- Fixed a bug with "$deleterole" where if multiple roles of the same name were found, the bot would not do anything.
    Now, Kaguya will delete all roles with the matched name.
- Updated "$DeleteTextChannel" and "$DeleteVoiceChannel" commands to properly delete the channels.
    Channels can now be mentioned (#<Channel>) or just the name of the channel will do.
- Fixed a bug with "$DeleteTextChannel" -- Kaguya would respond with a confirmation message for a successfully 
    deleted channel, even if the channel didn't exist in the first place.
- Fixed a small bug with "$unblacklist" where if the userAccount.Username property was `null`, it would be formatted weird.
    There are now two formats, one for if the username is null, and one for if the username isn't null (or empty).
- Added in some missing aliases in the help commands
- Fixed help command for "$groll" / "$gr"
- Added just more general fine-tuning to the list of help commands. ($h <cmd>)
- Commented out broken blackjack command, will uncomment it's finished.

Version 1.5.1

- High priority fix for crashes.


Version 1.5

- $filteradd [fa] added. Allows a server administrator to add words to a filter. If the word is typed in chat and is in the filter, the bot will automatically delete it.
    This applies for phrases including spaces as well.
- $filterremove [fr] added.
- $filterview [fv] added.
- $filterclear [clearfilter] added.
- $clear with no parameters now defaults to deleting 10 messages instead of 25.
- $setlogchannel / $log added. Sets the specified channel to be where the bot logs information.
- $resetlogchannel / $rlog added. Resets all log channels and disables logging (per log event -- $rlog all disables logging for the whole guild.)
- Updated $clear command so that it properly deletes the specified number of messages.
- New database file for cached server messages (this is required for proper logging).
- $awardeveryone / $awardall (new bot owner command).
- Fixed a bug with `$cmds utility` that prevented it from working.
- $g/$gamble has been renamed to $gr/$groll (all point gambling commands will start with g as of this patch.)
- $masspointsdistribute command added. This allows any user to evenly distribute all of their Kaguya points to everyone in the server.
    This, in turn, sets their own points to zero. What a generous act!
- Kaguya now sends a helpful message to the server owner upon joining a new guild.
- $massban now has a help command.
- Heavily cleaned up Misc.cs (huge file where all commands are). Now, 7 new classes are in existence, one for each module (Utility, Help, Fun, EXP, Currency, osu, and Administration.)
- $kaguyagtfo renamed to $kaguyaexit
- Modules and commands lists are now up to date.

Version 1.4.2.1
- Hotfix, files are now built/compiled properly. Definitely do not use any releases before this.

Version 1.4.2
- $timely now properly reads from commands.json. If commands.json is empty or doesn't exist, it will automatically be created as well.
- Updated modules/commands lists to be current.
- commands.json can now be edited almost exactly the same way as servers.json and accounts.json.


Version 1.4.1
- Implements a temporary fix for a bug that prevented $timely from working.


Version 1.4.0

- STAGEBOT HAS BEEN REBRANDED TO "Kaguya"!!!
- Added $rep command. Give your favorite person a rep point up to once per day!
- Added $scrapeserver command for bot owners. Generates accounts for every member of the server.
- $massblacklist will now ban any IGuildUser in the entire server regardless of whether they have typed in chat. Closes #17.
- Added in $profile command. Generates an image with a user's account information / statistics.
- Fixed a bug with $prefix where you could set a prefix greater than two characters. Closes #18
- Added in a bot response if a user types $recent or $osutop with no additional parameters, and has not set their osu name with $osuset.
- $serverexplb / $explb created, displays the top 10 users in the server in order of EXP.

- Added in an $author command
- Added in $repauthor command

Version 1.3.0

- $delteams modified to take up less space when deleting large amounts of teams. 
    No longer embeds an individual message for each team deleted. (Credit to Ludeo)
- Fixed a bug where the bot would crash when using $removeallroles. Closes #13
- Fixed a bug where $osutop's title link would give 404 errors. Closes #10
- Tweaked $osutop to now have the chosen user's proper name instead of the name specified when executing the command.
    By this I mean the displayed username will have the same capitalization as what is shown on the official osu! website,
    instead of the capitalization chosen when executing the command. If someone's $osuset name has different capitalization
    than what is on the website, it won't matter anymore. Closes #8
- Fixed a bug where deleterole wouldn't do anything if two roles have the same name. 
    Bot now deletes the first role it finds with the specified name. Closes #14
- $clear/$c/$purge updated to default to deleting 25 messages if no other number is specified. Closes #12
- Tweaked $timely to pull from commands.json (in the case of timelyHours ever being edited, the bot will auto-update the timeout for timely)
- Tweaked $exp
- Bot owners no longer have to be an admin of the server they use $pointsadd in.
- Same thing for $expadd ^
- $expadd now has an alias of $addexp
- $pick & $echo now give error responses if they are missing parameters.
- Added help command for $prefix
- Added $prefix into Utility module.

- Fixed improper naming of help command (used for debugging)
