Welcome to the Kaguya ChangeLog.


Changelog:

Version 1.5

- $filteradd [fa] added. Allows a server administrator to add words to a filter. If the word is typed in chat and is in the filter, the bot will automatically delete it.
    This applies for phrases including spaces as well.
- $filterremove [fr] added.
- $filterview [fv] added.
- $filterclear [clearfilter] added.
- $clear with no parameters now defaults to deleting 10 messages instead of 25.
- $setlogchannel added. Sets the specified channel to be where the bot logs information.
- Updated $clear command so that it properly deletes the specified number of messages.
- New database file for cached server messages (this is required for proper logging).
- $awardeveryone / $awardall (new bot owner command).
- Fixed a bug with `$cmds utility` that prevented it from working.
- $g/$gamble has been renamed to $gr/$groll (all point gambling commands will start with g as of this patch.)
- $masspointsdistribute command added. This allows any user to evenly distribute all of their Kaguya points to everyone in the server.
    This, in turn, sets their own points to zero. What a generous act!
- Kaguya now sends a helpful message to the server owner upon joining a new guild.
- $massban now has a help command.
- Heavily cleaned up Misc.cs (huge file where all commands are). Now, 7 new classes are in existence, one for each module (Utility, Help, Fun, EXP, Currency, osu, and Administration.)
- $kaguyagtfo renamed to $kaguyaexit
- Modules and commands lists are now up to date.

Version 1.4.2.1
- Hotfix, files are now built/compiled properly. Definitely do not use any releases before this.

Version 1.4.2
- $timely now properly reads from commands.json. If commands.json is empty or doesn't exist, it will automatically be created as well.
- Updated modules/commands lists to be current.
- commands.json can now be edited almost exactly the same way as servers.json and accounts.json.


Version 1.4.1
- Implements a temporary fix for a bug that prevented $timely from working.


Version 1.4.0

- STAGEBOT HAS BEEN REBRANDED TO "Kaguya"!!!
- Added $rep command. Give your favorite person a rep point up to once per day!
- Added $scrapeserver command for bot owners. Generates accounts for every member of the server.
- $massblacklist will now ban any IGuildUser in the entire server regardless of whether they have typed in chat. Closes #17.
- Added in $profile command. Generates an image with a user's account information / statistics.
- Fixed a bug with $prefix where you could set a prefix greater than two characters. Closes #18
- Added in a bot response if a user types $recent or $osutop with no additional parameters, and has not set their osu name with $osuset.
- $serverexplb / $explb created, displays the top 10 users in the server in order of EXP.
- Same thing for the global leaderboard! ($globalexplb / $gexplb)
- Added in an $author command
- Added in $repauthor command

Version 1.3.0

- $delteams modified to take up less space when deleting large amounts of teams. 
    No longer embeds an individual message for each team deleted. (Credit to Ludeo)
- Fixed a bug where the bot would crash when using $removeallroles. Closes #13
- Fixed a bug where $osutop's title link would give 404 errors. Closes #10
- Tweaked $osutop to now have the chosen user's proper name instead of the name specified when executing the command.
    By this I mean the displayed username will have the same capitalization as what is shown on the official osu! website,
    instead of the capitalization chosen when executing the command. If someone's $osuset name has different capitalization
    than what is on the website, it won't matter anymore. Closes #8
- Fixed a bug where deleterole wouldn't do anything if two roles have the same name. 
    Bot now deletes the first role it finds with the specified name. Closes #14
- $clear/$c/$purge updated to default to deleting 25 messages if no other number is specified. Closes #12
- Tweaked $timely to pull from commands.json (in the case of timelyHours ever being edited, the bot will auto-update the timeout for timely)
- Tweaked $exp
- Bot owners no longer have to be an admin of the server they use $pointsadd in.
- Same thing for $expadd ^
- $expadd now has an alias of $addexp
- $pick & $echo now give error responses if they are missing parameters.
- Added help command for $prefix
- Added $prefix into Utility module.


Version 1.2.0

- Fixed improper naming of help command (used for debugging)
- Added in $prefix, allowing servers to change the command prefix based on their preferences.
