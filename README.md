# Kaguya
Kaguya Bot Project Created by Stage

My goal for the Kaguya project is for Kaguya to be one of the top general purpose bots to exist in the Discord Bot "marketplace" so to speak. Packed with dozens of features already, with many dozens to come, Kaguya makes a superb addition to any Discord server!

### It should be noted that, unfortunately, Kaguya is not very "self-hoster" friendly, even though you can compile the code yourself and insert your own Token. You will find with self hosting that there are some hard-coded values, like my name as the creator of the bot, and Kaguya as the bot itself (not whatever your bot's name is). For the forseeable future, I cannot see myself adding in support for self-hosting.
